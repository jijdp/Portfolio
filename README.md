## About Me
I'm a software tester who recently graduated from college. I'm looking for an opportunity to work as a full-time/contract software tester. I have experience with manual testing/test cases/finding bugs and defects/using some relevant tools such as Zephyr and Jira. I have a basic knowledge of SQL and currently learn to understand agile and scrum. I’m also intrigued to learn about automated tests and any skills that enhance my ability.

I’m open for all types: On-site / Hybrid / Remote +++ Full-time / Contract / Intern

Languages I speak: English (Professional) / Thai (Native) / French (Low-intermediate)
