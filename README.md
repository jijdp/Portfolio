## About Me
I'm a software tester who is looking for an opportunity to work in this role full-time. I have experience with manual testing and automated tests. I can write test cases, find bugs/defects and use management tools such as Jira and Trello . I can test API with Postman and test codeless with Selenium IDE. I have knowledge of SQL/MySQL and understand how to work in agile/scrum. I’m also intrigued to learn any skills that enhance my ability.
